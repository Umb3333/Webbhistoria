                <h3 style="color:#989898;"> So how does the internet work? The answer is a technology that could begin to be used as early as 1974. But it has not been a given that precisely TCP/IP, <br> as the technology is called, would build the internet. Powerful opponents have thought otherwise.</h3>

                    <h1 style="color:#989898;">This is how TCP/IP works - the technology behind the internet</h1>
                <h3 style="color:#989898;">The TCP and IP protocols make it possible to quickly send packets of information between connected computers and networks. Everything decentralized. The system is based on the fact that the networks do not control the information that is sent and is crucial to the success of the Internet. It works a bit like the post office, they don't care what you send and how, only the package arrives. And that's not all: the packages are split up and sent in pieces, and then put together when they have reached their destination via different routes.</h3>

                <h3 style="color:#989898;">Since it is still TCP/IP that builds communication via the Internet, many believe that it is Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn who are best suited to be called "the creators of the Internet".</h3>

                    <h1 style="color:#989898;">The X.25 system challenges TCP/IP</h1>
                <h3 style="color:#989898;">But victory is not a given. In 1976 another system is launched: X.25.
                    It is, unlike TCP/IP, centralized. It is also the favorite of the telecommunications companies, including the Swedish one. For a long time, it has been believed that the exchange of information between computers is to be developed with that technology.</h3>

                <h3 style="color:#989898;">One reason is that the system gives the telecommunications companies the opportunity to charge for the traffic. Another is that X.25 networks are very secure, as each link in the chain error-checks the content before passing it on.
                    In this way, you can guarantee that the information is identical from start to finish. A bit like a letter that is read and checked by everyone who is reached by it during the journey.</h3>

                <h3 style="color:#989898;">However, the process has a price: it is a bit slow. The telecommunications companies finally have to give in, the faster and more flexible TCP/IP takes the lead as early as January 1, 1983 when the American Arpanet chooses the protocol, and it is still the architecture the network is based on.</h3> <br>
                <h3 style="color:#989898;"> In 1985, the Swedish telecommunications company changed the name of its X.25 service to Datapak, a name that is still used.
                    In the past, it has been called both Telepak and Database 300. X.25 technology is still alive, but in contexts where the importance of security is particularly great, such as when paying with a credit card or withdrawing money from an ATM.</h3>
